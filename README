Useful Scripts.

This provides a set of -- what I find -- useful scripts. If you find any of them
useful, feel free to use them to your hearts content

THESE SCRIPTS ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Get main repository:

$ mkdir useful
$ cd useful
$ brz init-repo
$ brz branch lp:useful my_branch
$ cd my_branch

To you can do a merge request on both GitHub and Launchpad, but I prefer it
if you use launchpad.

$ cd path/to/useful
$ brz branch trunk some_branch
$ cd some_branch
$ # do some hacking
$ brz push lp:~username/useful/some_branch

To push a branch to github, you have to set up git to work with github, then
you can do the following:

$ cd path/to/useful/some_branch
$ brz push --lossy github:username/useful,branch=my_branch

To pull from GitHub (into a bazaar tree):

$ cd path/to/useful
$ brz branch trunk some_branch
$ cd some_branch
$ brz pull github:username/useful,branch=some_branch

You can also use brz transparently with git, this will pull the repo as git:

$ cd path/to/useful
$ brz branch github:username/useful.git some_branch

You can then merge from and to the bazaar tree.

$ cd some_bzr_branch
$ brz diff ../some_git_branch.git

or

$ cd some_git_branch.git
$ brz diff ../some_bzr_branch
